Media Mover
===================================================================================================================================

Some scripts for sorting media files pulled from cameras, phones or iPhoto

Why?
-----------
Initially I wanted to free my photos and movies from iPhoto.
After that has been done using the `iphoto` scripts, the script `fotoarchiver` is used
to move or copy media files from a flat directory to a target directory sorting them
into a 'year/month' sub directory struture.

Tools
-----
- Java 8
- Groovy 2.x
